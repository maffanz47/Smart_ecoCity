This is my CS-112 (object oriented programming) project.
It is a simple implementation of a eco-friendly city system using object-oriented programming principles in C++.
It includes classes for City, Building, and Vehicle, and demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
This project also uses simple mathematical algorithms to calculate the total emissions of the city and the total emissions of each vehicle.
There is a basic machine learning algorithm manually applied to predict the temperature based on readings from a weather station.
The project also includes a simple data clustering algorithm to visulaize the data on console
